 # India Suicide Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into suicide trends across India by leveraging data and visualizing it through a Power BI dashboard. The SQL file included in this repository is used to query and transform raw suicide data, preparing it for analysis and visualization.

## Features
- **State-wise Analysis**: Shows the distribution of suicides across Indian states.
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Displays insights based on age groups, gender, and occupation.
- **Method of Suicide**: Analyzes the methods of suicide.
- **Trends Over Time**: Visualizes the increase or decrease in suicide rates over different time periods.
- **Key Metrics**: Provides essential statistics like total suicides and state with the highest suicide rate.

## Data Source
The SQL file queries data that contains records of suicides reported in India, categorized by various demographic and geographical factors. Ensure you have the correct dataset in your database before running the queries.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- SQL Server or any compatible SQL database.
- Power BI Desktop for visualizing the data (optional).


## SQL File Breakdown
The SQL file performs the following tasks:
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares the raw data by handling null values, removing duplicates, and formatting fields.
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarizes suicide data by state, age group, gender, and method of suicide.
 

## Visualizing the Data (Optional)
Once the SQL query has been run, the data can be visualized in Power BI. Suggested visuals include:
- **KPI Cards**: To show total suicides, year-on-year change etc.
- **Column Charts**: For analyzing suicide data by state and age group.
- **Bar and Line Charts**: To display trends over time and by occupation or method of suicide.
